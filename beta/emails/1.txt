Hi All,

Thanks for joining the iOS Beta Testers,

You should receive an email from "TestFlight (no_reply@email.apple.com)" with a Subject of "TestFlight: There is an update available for 599CD TV 1.0 (x)‚Äè".
I originally created the App as an Apple TV app but i'm going to drop that from the name when it's released.

Make sure to accept this email then it should show up in the TestFlight app and you can download it to either your iPhone or iPad.

You will be asked to login, use your 599CD login. If you have an app called 1Password you can use that to find and use your password.

This will use your mobile data to steam the videos from the web, in the same way as if you were just using safari.
You can track how much in Settings | Mobile Data, turn this off if required.

To Do
I'm looking to update the images on the initial page as they are quite pixelated.
I'm also looking at resizing the video screen depending on whether you are in Portrait or Landscape.

Please let me know any comments, suggestions for changes, any features you'd like to see and anything that isn't working.

Thanks
Alex
