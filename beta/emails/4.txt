Hi All,

v1.0.8 should be out soon,

New
- Autoplay
- Themes
- New Settings
- Filter MyCourses
- Tips

I'm still looking at the web view scroll bar issue,

Let me know how the theme switching works, at the minute you can change it in settings but you have to close and reopen the app to take effect, I need to add some notification checks
