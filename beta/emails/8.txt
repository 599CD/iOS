Hi All,

Build 21 is now available, you should have an email from Apple (TestFlight), if not check the TestFlight App or let me know and I'll send it again,

I've updated how the app gets the courses etc so check each screen to see it's all still working,

I thought I'd fixed AutoPlay next but it's still causing issues for certain iOS versions so might still have to leave that out :(

Any more features you'd like?
Putting Seminars in their own section was one,

Thanks,
Alex
